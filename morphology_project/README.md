# Computational morphology final project

Here you can find the files for the Icelandic morphological generator/analyzer I did for the course "Computational morphology.

To run the program you need both the "icelandic.lexc" and "icelandic.xfst" files. Use a tool you like, for example Foma or HFST and run the command

    source icelandic.xfst

The program automatically prints out the lower forms of the words in the lexicon. After running the command, you can search for upper or lower forms of the words in the program's lexicon as you like.
