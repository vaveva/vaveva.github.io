## Introduction

A language technology major at the University of Helsinki with a Bachelor's degree in Scandinavian languages (Swedish as second domestic language). For my Bachelor's thesis I made an error analysis of Swedish to Finnish translations by Google translate (in Swedish).

Currently looking for something productive to do during the summer.
