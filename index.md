## Introduction

I am a Language Technology major at the University of Helsinki with a Bachelor's degree in Scandinavian Languages (Swedish as second domestic language). For my Bachelor's thesis I made an error analysis of Swedish to Finnish translations by Google translate (in Swedish).

Currently trying to compe up with something productive to do during the summer.
